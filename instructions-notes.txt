***INSTRUCTIONS******************************

This week you will be working together as a team to create a full CRUD application.
Your console CRUD application will need to use a database to store all the application data.
You need to have at least 3 entities.
Users should be able to interact via the console (i.e. Scanner(System.in)))
You can organize your code however you like, but I would encourage you to follow an organizational
model similar to the one in last weeks video with packages dao, entity, and if you need, service.
The project must be on GitHub. Use git to collaborate.
Everyone will be graded on their individual contributions.
This project is worth 200 points as it is taking the place of your research assignment and quiz.

***NOTES**************************************

Notes from class brainstorming session:
At least 3 entities/1 repo

Entity possibilities
	1) Classes/Character types of magic users
	2) Abilities
	3) Lore/Story
	4) Vehicles
	5) Weapons
	6) Pets/familiars

• All entities need the four CRUD operations
• Create a DB connection: username/pw same for all users for ease of use. One person start the DB script and everyone add to it with their tables, etc.
• Everyone uses/creates a vertical slice that includes tables, data for the class, DAO, menu interface portion.
• Each class does 1 specific thing

Layers to consider: Service layer with calculations, Controller layer to get input, DAO layer
